# PopInterp
Interpolating population from historical censuses
The main goal of this repository is to provide a step-by-step guide/tutorial on how to conduct interpolation on age-structured population data. This repository is expected to be useful for historians, historical demographers and historical epidemiologists who often need between-census population data to calculate mortality and other health-related rates.

The tutorial is mainly based on the "interp" package in the "DemoTools" R library (Riffe et al. 2019, https://rdrr.io/github/timriffe/DemoTools/man/interp.html) and census data between 1849 and 1930 from Amsterdam, the Netherlands. 

The tutorial has been made as part of the research project titled "Lifting the burden of disease. The modernisation of health in the Netherlands: Amsterdam 1854-1940" (https://www.ru.nl/rich/our-research/research-groups/radboud-group-historical-demography-family-history/current-research-projects/current-projects/lifting-burden-disease/).
